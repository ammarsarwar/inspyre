    <strong>MISSION STATEMENT</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. InspYre's mission is to provide a safe and fair environment for
        people to exercise their gifts and talents with the goal of creating a
        better life for themselves and their families.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. For the first time, we wanted our indigenous resources and minerals
        to create REAL opportunities for our Brand Ambassadors, create
        employment and business opportunities for the African Farmers and
        manufacturers where products ingredients are sourced. This allows us as
        the InspYre Nation to finally plow back into Africa&rsquo;s economy and
        watch it flourish!
      </li>
      <li>
        3. We know that it takes a small number of people to create a big
        change. We wanted to change other people's lives for the better, just as
        our lives have changed. We, therefore, decided to create a safe haven
        for everyone.

  <li><strong>CODE OF ETHICS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  First and Foremost INSPYRE is built on a foundation of integrity, ethics,
  edification and trust. Whether dealing with your Customers, fellow Brand
  Ambassador or the Company you should always give and expect to receive above
  all. As&nbsp; an INSPYRE Brand&nbsp; Ambassador, you are expected to operate
  your business according to the highest standards of integrity and fair
  practice in your role as INSPYRE BrandAmbassador. Failure to comply with the
  Code of Ethics can result in termination of your status as an INSPYRE Brand
  Ambassador. The Code of Ethics, therefore, states:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    1. When describing INSPYRE Compensation Plan, all the statements must be
    truthful, accurate and not misleading, strictly based on actual experiences
    and INSPYRE authorized materials.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    2. Make sure complaints of product quality are dealt with immediately and in
    a polite and friendly manner, in accordance with the procedures of
    INSPYRE-authorized materials.

    INSPYRE-authorized materials.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    5. All activities will be measured against the P&amp;P. When combined with
    common sense and camaraderie, a powerful synergy will develop. Anything that
    detracts from this should be dealt with immediately, first through your
    upline organization, then to the Company if necessary. Destruction of this
    foundation will not be tolerated. Application to become an Independent Brand
    Ambassador of the Company requires that the applicant agree to conduct
    business according to the following Code of Conduct. This code ensures high
    standards of integrity, ethics and professionalism throughout the
    Company&rsquo;s network of Independent Brand Ambassadors and protects the
    Company&rsquo;s overall business image.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    6. Only INSPYRE authorized materials, including business tools, video
    materials and other existing business supports only can be used while
    describing INSPYRE business plan, products, services or any other business
    activities.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    7. As an INSPYRE Independent Brand Ambassadors, I agree to comply with the
    following principles to operate INSPYRE Individual business: Comply with
    Code of Ethics, Policies &amp; Procedures and other versions of authorized
    literature.

    with InspYre, regardless of race, gender, social class, or religion, thereby

    community spirit.
  </li>
  <li>
    7.3. I will provide support and encouragement to my customers and other
    Brand Ambassadors to ensure that their experience with INSPYRE is
    successful.
  </li>
  <li>
    7.4. I will motivate and actively work with Brand Ambassadors in my downline
    organization to help them build their INSPYRE business. I understand that
    this support is critical to each Brand Ambassador&rsquo;s success in
    INSPYRE.
  </li>
  <li>
    7.5. I will refrain from making income claims, exaggerating my personal
    income or the income potential in general and will stress to the Brand
    Ambassador candidates the level of effort and commitment required to succeed
    in the business.
  </li>
  <li>
    7.6. I will not abuse the goodwill of my association with INSPYRE to further
    or promote other business interests (particularly those which may be
    competitive to INSPYRE) without the prior written consent of INSPYRE.
  </li>
  <li>
    7.7. I will not make disparaging remarks about other products, services,
    Brand Ambassador, or companies; likewise, I will not willfully denigrate the
    activities or personalities of fellow Brand Ambassadors.
  </li>
  <li>

        received within five (5) business days of your enrollment for you to

        Ambassador Agreement is not received within five (5) business days, your

      </li>
      <li>
        2.2. A potential new Independent Brand Ambassador may also enroll on the
        Sponsor&rsquo;s replicated website. Instead of a physically signed
        Independent Brand Ambassador Agreement, We will accept the
        web-enrollment through the &ldquo;electronic signature.&rdquo; The
        electronic signature signifies that the new Independent Brand Ambassador
        has accepted the terms and conditions of the Independent Brand
        Ambassador Agreement, the Policies and Procedures, the Terms of Use, and
        the Compensation Plan. Please note that such electronic signature

        2.3. Signed documents, including, but not limited to Independent Brand
        Ambassador agreements, are legally binding contracts which must not be
        altered, tampered with or changed in any manner after execution. False
        or misleading information, forged signatures or alterations to any
        document, including business registration forms, made after a document
        has been executed may lead to sanctions, up to and including involuntary
        termination of the Independent Brand Ambassadors&rsquo;s business.
      </li>
      <li>2.4. Business Entities:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    A corporation, partnership, PTY, or trust (collectively referred to as a
    &ldquo;Business Entity&rdquo;) may apply to be an Independent Brand
    Ambassador. This Independent Brand Ambassador business and position will
    remain temporary until the submission of proper documents. As examples of
    proper documents, We expect a Business Entity application to come with some
    of the following: Certificate of Incorporation, Articles of Organization,
    Partnership Agreement or appropriate Trust documents. We must receive these
    documents within five (5) business days from the date of the Independent
    Brand Ambassador Agreement&rsquo;s execution. The Business Entity should
    scan and send all applicable documents to complaint@inspyre<a
      href="http://www.com"
      >com</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A validly formed business entity may become an IBA, provided it can submit
    valid documentation as may be requested by INSPYRE.
  </li>
  <li>
    An individual may not participate in or have any beneficial interest in more
    than one (1) Brand Ambassador business of any kind. The person signing the

    equity in the business has had an interest in an Brand Ambassador business
    with INSPYRE within six (6) months of the date of signature.

        5.1. <strong><em>General</em></strong
        ><em>: </em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            5.1.1. Each Brand Ambassador must immediately notify INSPYRE of all
            changes to the information contained in his or her Brand Ambassador
            Application and Agreement. Brand Ambassadors may modify their
            existing Brand Ambassador Agreement Form by submitting a written
            request and appropriate supporting documentation. In order to change
            any IBA information, you will be asked to fill out an IBA
            Information Change Request Form which can be requested from our
            Compliance Staff for review and processing.

<ul>
  <li>
    5.2. <strong><em>Changes of Enroller</em></strong> :
    <ul>
      <li>
        5.2.1. To protect the integrity of all marketing organizations and
        safeguard the hard work of all Brand Ambassadors, INSPYRE does not allow
        changes in enroller for active Brand Ambassadors. Maintaining the
        integrity of the enrollment ship is critical for the success of every
        Brand Ambassador and marketing organization. Accordingly, the transfer
        of an Inspyre business from one enroller to another is not permitted.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.2.2. Exception &ndash; A request for a change in enroller, due to
        INSPYRE error, will be accepted within 3 days of the submission of the
        new Brand Ambassador application. There are instances where transfer of
        ownership of an account will be permitted with appropriate documents
        filled out. All Brand Ambassadors that are approved for this transfer of
        ownership will be required to fill out the &lsquo;IBA Transfer of
        Ownership Form&rsquo;.
      </li>

  <li>
    <strong><em>5.3. </em></strong
    ><strong><em>Protecting Sponsor Lines</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        5.3.1. A Brand Ambassador may only have a position in one line of
        sponsorship, and not in two or more. No Brand Ambassador may register a
        new position in a line other than his/her own downline. Attempts to the
        contrary will be filtered out and blocked by INSPYRE.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.3.2. As a general rule, INSPYRE does not support requests for a change
        in sponsorship lines. In isolated instances, however, INSPYRe may
        approve such requests in the interest of the network as a whole &ndash;
        providing all affected enrollers (up to 5 -7 generations up) agree in
        writing to the requested change (downlines are not required to give
        their approval). In the event of a change of sponsorship request is
        examined and approved, (a form from our Advocacy Department named
        Application Form to Change Sponsor Lines) will be sent to the member
        requesting the change and all parties affected will be notified.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.3.3. only the Brand Ambassador making the request will be placed under
        a new sponsor (the partner&rsquo;s downline remains intact in the old
        line of sponsorship and no downline will be repositioned); or
      </li>
      <li>
        5.3.4. under extreme circumstances the entire downline may be
        repositioned under a new sponsor. Subject to investigation and approved
        by the Compliance and Legal Department.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.3.5. When sponsors are changed, all previous activities, accumulated
        BV points and bonuses will be lost. There will be strict guidelines for
        the new position not to entice or coerce any of the previous sponsor
        line to move lines as this will be a direct breach of the Policies and
        Procedures under the Cross-Recruitment policy. This will result in
        termination of all accounts associated with this action(s).
      </li>
    </ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><em>5.4. </em></strong
    ><strong><em>Cancellation and Re-application</em></strong>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A Brand Ambassador may legitimately change organization by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    5.4.1. Voluntarily cancelling his or her INSPYRE Agreement and remaining
    inactive (i.e., no purchases of INSPYRE products; no sales of INSPYRE
    products; no enrolling; no attendance at any INSPYRE functions, no
    participation in any other form of Brand Ambassador activity, and no
    operation of any other INSPYRE business) for 6 full calendar months.
  </li>
  <li>
    5.4.2. Following the 6-calendar month period of inactivity, the former Brand
    Ambassador may reapply under a new enroller. However, the former Brand
    Ambassador will permanently lose any and all right to their former Brand
    Ambassador Downline organization. &ldquo;Downline&rdquo; shall mean the
    organization of Independent Brand Ambassadors that enroll and are placed
    under any Independent Brand Ambassador.
  </li>
  <li>
    5.4.3. INSPYRe will consider waiving the six month waiting period under
    exceptional circumstances. If a Brand Ambassador has set up a second account
    without waiting the six months period by using a new name, business entity,
    or by other means. Inspyre considers this behavior a violation of policy and
    unethical. INSPYRE reserves the right to move that Brand Ambassador to the
    original position at any time. Such requests for waiver must be submitted to
    INSPYRE in writing.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Unauthorized Claims and Actions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>1. </strong><strong>Indemnification</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.1. A Brand Ambassador is fully responsible for all of his or her
        verbal and written statements made regarding INSPYRE products, services,
        and the Compensation Plan that are not expressly contained in official
        INSPYRE materials. This includes statements and representations made
        through all sources of communication media, whether person-to-person, in
        meetings, online, through Social Media, in print, or any other means of
        communication. Brand Ambassadors agree to indemnify INSPYRE and
        INSPYRE&rsquo;s directors, board, officers, employees and agents and
        hold them harmless from any and all liability, including judgments,
        civil penalties, refunds, attorney fees, court costs or lost business
        incurred by INSPYRE as a result of the Brand Ambassador&rsquo;s
        unauthorized representations or actions. This provision shall survive
        the termination of the Brand Ambassador Agreement.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>2. </strong><strong>Product Claims</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2.1. No representation or sales offers may be made relating to INSPYRE
        product(s) that are not accurate or truthful as to grade, quality,
        performance, and availability. Appropriate product information is
        contained in authorized INSPYRE literature and is subject to periodic
        review and revision by INSPYRE. It is the Brand Ambassador&rsquo;s
        responsibility to obtain and use only current literature and materials.
        All product representations made by a Brand Ambassador must be the same
        as those found in current INSPYRE literature.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.2. No claims (which include personal testimonials) as to therapeutic,
        curative or beneficial properties of any products offered by INSPYRE may
        be made except those contained in official INSPYRE literature.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.3. In particular, no IBA may make any claim that INSPYRE products are
        useful in the cure, treatment, diagnosis, mitigation or prevention of
        any diseases or symptoms of diseases. Such statements can be perceived
        as drug claims, and they may lack adequate substantiation. Not only are
        such claims in violation of the Brand Ambassador Agreement, they also
        violate the laws and regulations of South Africa and other
        jurisdictions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>3. </strong><strong>Claims of Illegal Uses</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  When promoting INSPYRe products, Brand Ambassadors shall not make any verbal
  or written statement regarding the use&mdash;or potential use&mdash;of INSPYRE
  products for any illegal purpose. This includes, but is not limited to,
  statements regarding knowledge of the illegal use of INSPYRE products by the
  Brand Ambassador or any third party, the compatibility of INSPYRE products
  with any other product known to be used for illegal purposes, or the potential
  compatibility of INSPYRE products with any other product known or unknown that
  would facilitate any practice prohibited by law. Brand Ambassadors agree to
  indemnify INSPYRE and INSPYRE&rsquo;s directors, officers, employees and
  agents and hold them harmless from any and all liability, including judgments,
  civil penalties, refunds, attorney fees, court costs or lost business incurred
  by INSPYRE as a result of any such statements made by the Brand Ambassador.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>4. </strong><strong>Income Claims and Marketing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4.1. In their enthusiasm to enroll prospective Brand Ambassadors, some
        Brand Ambassadors are occasionally tempted to make health claims or
        income claims or earnings representations to demonstrate the inherent
        power of network marketing. This is counterproductive because new Brand
        Ambassadors may become disappointed very quickly if their results are
        not as extensive or as rapid as the results others have achieved.
      </li>
      <li>
        4.2. When presenting or discussing the INSPYRE Compensation Plan, you
        must make it clear to prospects that financial success with INSPYRE
        requires commitment, effort, and sales skill. Conversely, you must never
        represent that one can be successful without diligently applying
        themselves. Examples of misrepresentations in this area include:
        <ul>
          <li>4.2.1.1. Get rich quick</li>
          <li>4.2.1.2. No work required</li>
          <li>4.2.1.3. No selling required</li>
          <li>4.2.1.4. Just join and I'll build your downline for you</li>
          <li>4.2.1.5. Just join and your downline will get spillover</li>
          <li>4.2.1.6. The company does all the work for you</li>
          <li>4.2.1.7. All you have to do is buy your products every month</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        4.3. The above are merely examples of improper representations about the
        Compensation Plan. It is important that you do not make these or any
        other representations that could lead a prospect to believe that they
        can be successful as an INSPYRE Brand Ambassador without commitment,
        effort, and sales skill.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Income Disclosure Statement</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  InspYre corporate ethics compel us to do not merely what is legally required,
  but rather, to conduct the absolute best business practices. To this end, we
  have developed the InspYre Income Disclosure Statement ("IDS"). The INSPYRE
  IDS is designed to convey truthful, timely, and comprehensive information
  regarding the income that INSPYRE Brand Ambassador earns. In order to
  accomplish this objective, a copy of the IDS must be presented to all
  prospective Brand Ambassadors. Inset pdf url pdf.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  The failure to comply with this policy constitutes a significant and material
  breach of the INSPYRE Brand Ambassador Agreement and will be grounds for
  disciplinary sanctions, including termination, pursuant to Section 40
  (Disciplinary Sanctions).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  A Brand Ambassador, when presenting or discussing the InspYre opportunity or
  Compensation Plan to a prospective Brand Ambassador, may not make income
  projections, income claims, or disclose his or her INSPYRE income (including
  the showing of checks, copies of checks, bank statements, or tax records)
  unless, at the time the presentation is made, the Brand Ambassador provides a
  current copy of the INSPYRE Income Disclosure Statement (IDS) to the person(s)
  to whom he or she is making the presentation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  A copy of the IDS must be presented to a prospective Brand Ambassador (someone
  who is not a party to a current InspYre Brand Ambassador Agreement) anytime
  the Compensation Plan is presented or discussed, or any type of income claim,
  or earnings representation is made.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  The terms "income claim" and/or "earnings representation" (collectively
  "income claim") include: (1) statements of actual earnings; (2) statements of
  projected earnings; (3) statements of earnings ranges; (4) income
  testimonials; (5) lifestyle claims; and (6) hypothetical claims.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  A lifestyle income claim typically includes statements (or pictures) involving
  large homes, luxury cars, exotic vacations, or other items suggesting or
  implying wealth. They also consist of references to the achievement of one's
  dreams, having everything one always wanted, and are phrased in terms of
  "opportunity" or "possibility" or "chance." Claims such as "My InspYre income
  exceeded my salary after six months in the business," or "Our InspYre business
  has allowed my wife to come home and be a full-time mom" also fall within the
  purview of "lifestyle" claims.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  A hypothetical income claim exists when you attempt to explain the operation
  of the compensation plan through the use of a hypothetical example. Certain
  assumptions are made regarding some or all of the following: (1) number of
  personally-enrolled Customers and Brand Ambassador; (2) number of downline
  Customers and Brand Ambassador; (3) average sales/purchase volume/sales volume
  per Customer and Brand Ambassador; and (4) total organizational volume.
  Applying these assumptions through the compensation plan yields income figures
  which constitute hypothetical income claims.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  In any non-public meeting (e.g., a home meeting, one-on-one, regardless of
  venue) with a prospective Brand Ambassador(s) or IBA&rsquo;s in which the
  Compensation Plan is discussed or any type of income claim is made, you must
  provide the prospect(s) with a copy of the IDS. In any meeting that is open to
  the public in which the Compensation Plan is discussed, or any type of income
  claims is made, you must provide every prospective Brand Ambassador with a
  copy of the IDS and you must display at least one (3 foot x 5 foot poster
  board) in the front of the room in reasonably close proximity to the
  presenter(s). In any meeting in which any type of video display is utilized
  (e.g., monitor, television, projector, etc.) a slide of the IDS must be
  displayed continuously throughout the duration of any discussion of the
  Compensation Plan or the making of an income claim. Copies of the IDS may be
  printed or downloaded without charge from the corporate website at
  www.inspyreww.com.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Brand Ambassadors who develop sales aids and tools in which the Compensation
  Plan or income claims are present must incorporate the IDS into each such
  sales aid or tool prior to submission to the Company for review.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Prohibited Re-Packaging and Re-Labeling&nbsp; </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  INSPYRE products may only be sold in their original packaging. Brand
  Ambassador may not repackage, re-label, or alter the labels on INSPYRE
  products. Tampering with labels/packaging could be a violation of federal and
  state laws and may result in civil or criminal liability. Brand Ambassador may
  affix a personalized sticker with your personal/contact information to each
  product or product container, as long as you do so without removing existing
  labels or covering any text, graphics, or other material on the product label.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Commercial Outlets</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Brand Ambassadors may not sell INSPYRE products from a commercial outlet, nor
  may Brand Ambassadors display or sell INSPYRE products or literature in any
  retail or service establishment. Online auction and/or sales facilitation
  websites, including but not limited to Takealot,eBay and Craig's List
  constitute Commercial Outlets, and may not be used to sell INSPYRE products.
  In any non-public meeting (e.g., a home meeting, one-on-one, regardless of
  venue) with a prospective Brand Ambassador or Brand Ambassadors in which the
  Compensation Plan is discussed or any type of income claim is made, you must
  provide the prospect(s) with a copy of the IDS. In any meeting that is open to
  the public in which the Compensation Plan is discussed, or any type of income
  claims is made, you must provide every prospective Brand Ambassador with a
  copy of the IDS and you must display at least one (3 foot x 5 foot poster
  board) in the front of the room in reasonably close proximity to the
  presenter(s). In any meeting in which any type of video display is utilized
  (e.g., monitor, television, projector, etc.) a slide of the IDS must be
  displayed continuously throughout the duration of any discussion of the
  Compensation Plan or the making of an income claim. Copies of the IDS may be
  printed or downloaded without charge from the corporate website at
  www.MyDailyChoice.com. Brand Ambassadors who develop sales aids and tools in
  which the Compensation Plan or income claims are present must incorporate the
  IDS into each such sales aid or tool prior to submission to the Company for
  review.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Trade Shows, Expositions and Other Sales Forums</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
  Brand Ambassadors may display and/or sell INSPYRE products at trade shows and
  professional expositions. Before submitting a deposit to the event promoter,
  Brand Ambassadors must contact the Compliance department
  (compliance@inspyreww.com) in writing for conditional authorization, as
  INSPYRE's policy is to authorize only one INSPYRE business per event. Final
  authorization will be granted to the first Brand Ambassador who submits an
  official advertisement of the event, a copy of the contract signed by both the
  Brand Ambassador and the event official, and a receipt indicating that a
  deposit for the booth has been paid. Approval is given only for the event
  specified. Any requests to participate in future events must again be
  submitted to the Compliance Department. INSPYRE further reserves the right to
  refuse authorization to participate at any function which it does not deem a
  suitable forum for the promotion of its products or the INSPYRE opportunity.

  <li><strong>Conflicts of Interest </strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1. </strong><strong>Competition Policy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  INSPYRE Brand Ambassadors are free to participate in other multilevel or
  network marketing business ventures or marketing opportunities (collectively
  &ldquo;network marketing&rdquo;), with the exception of those products in the
  same generic category as INSPYRE products or services. Brand Ambassadors may
  not display INSPYRE products with any other products or services in a fashion
  that might in any way confuse or mislead a prospective Customer or Brand
  Ambassador into believing there is a relationship between the INSPYRE and
  non&ndash;INSPYRE products or services.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>2. </strong><strong>Non&ndash;solicitation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2.1. During the term of this Agreement, Brand Ambassadors may not
        recruit other INSPYRE Brand Ambassadors or customers for any other
        network marketing business. Following the cancellation of this Agreement
        for any reason, and for a period of one year thereafter, a former Brand
        Ambassador may not recruit any INSPYRE Brand Ambassador or customer for
        another network marketing business. The Brand Ambassadors and Company
        recognize that because network marketing is conducted through networks
        of independent contractors dispersed across the entire United States,
        and business is commonly conducted via the Internet and telephone, an
        effort to narrowly limit the geographic scope of this
        non&ndash;solicitation provision would render it wholly ineffective.
        Therefore, the Brand Ambassadors and Company agree that this
        non&ndash;solicitation provision shall apply to all markets in which
        INSPYRE conducts business, unless such company is doing business.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.2. The term &ldquo;recruit&rdquo; means actual or attempted
        solicitation, enrollment, encouragement or effort to influence in any
        other way, either directly or through a third party, another INSPYRE
        Brand Ambassador or customer to enroll or participate in another
        multi-level marketing, network marketing or direct sales opportunity.

      >Brand Ambassador Participation in Other Network Marketing
      Programs</strong
    >
    <ul>
      <li>
        3.1. If a Brand Ambassador is engaged in other non-INSPYRE network
        marketing business, it is the responsibility of the Brand Ambassador to
        ensure that his or her INSPYRE business is operated entirely separate
        and apart from any other network marketing business. To this end, the
        following must be adhered to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            3.1.1. Brand Ambassadors must not sell, or attempt to sell, any
            competing non-INSPYRE programs, products or services to INSPYRE
            Customers or Brand Ambassadors. Any program, product or services in
            the same generic categories as INSPYRE products is deemed to be
            competing, regardless of differences in cost, quality or other
            distinguishing factors. This provision does not apply where
            professional services are the primary source of revenues and the
            product sales are secondary to the provision of such services (e.g.,
            physician's offices, health clinics, health clubs, gyms, spas or
            beauty salons). However, a Brand Ambassador may sell non-competing
            products to INSPYRE Customers or Brand Ambassadors who are
            personally-sponsored.
          </li>
          <li>
            3.1.2. Brand Ambassadors shall not display INSPYRE promotional
            material, sales aids or products with or in the same location as,
            any non-INSPYRE promotional material or sales aids, products or
            services.
          </li>
          <li>
            3.1.3. Brand Ambassadors shall not offer the INSPYRE opportunity or
            products to prospective or existing &bull; Customers or Brand
            Ambassadors in conjunction with any non-INSPYRE program,
            opportunity, product or service.
          </li>
          <li>
            3.1.4. Brand Ambassadors may not offer any non-INSPYRE opportunity,
            products, services or opportunity at any INSPYRE-related meeting,
            seminar, convention, webinar, teleconference, or other function.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Downline Activity Reports are provided to Brand Ambassadors in the strictest
  of confidence and are made available to Brand Ambassadors for the sole purpose
  of assisting Brand INSPYRE would not provide Downline Activity Reports to the
  Brand Ambassador.
</p>
<p>
  A Brand Ambassador shall not, on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of any
  other person, partnership, association, corporation or other entity:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Directly or indirectly disclose any information contained in any Downline
    Activity Report to any third party;

    report or in any manner attempt to influence or induce any Brand Ambassador
    or customer of INSPYRE to alter their business relationship with INSPYRE;
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use or disclose to any person, partnership, association, corporation or
    other entity any information contained in any Downline Activity Report.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upon demand by the Company, any current or former Brand Ambassador will
    return the original and all copies of Downline Activity Reports to the
    Company.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Cross-Enrolling </strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1.1. Actual or attempted cross&ndash;enrolling is strictly prohibited.
    &ldquo;Cross&ndash;enrolling&rdquo; is defined as the enrollment of an
    individual or entity that is already a current Customer or Brand Ambassador
    of INSPYRE, or who has had such an agreement within the preceding 6 calendar
    months, within a different line of enrollmentship. The use of a spouse or
    relative&rsquo;s name, a straw man, trade names, assumed names or fictitious
    ID numbers to circumvent this policy is prohibited. Brand Ambassadors shall
    not demean, discredit or defame other INSPYRE Brand Ambassadors in an
    attempt to entice another Brand Ambassador to become part of the first Brand
    Ambassador&rsquo;s marketing organization. If a prohibited organization
    transfer occurs, INSPYRE shall take disciplinary action against the Brand
    Ambassador(s) who engaged, acquiesced and/or knowingly participated in the
    improper cross&ndash;enrolling. However, it shall be entirely within
    INSPYRE&rsquo;s discretion where in the genealogical structure, the
    cross&ndash;enrolled organization in question shall be placed or otherwise
    distributed.
  </li>
  <li>
    1.2. Because equities often exist in favor of both Upline organizations,
    BRAND AMBASSADORS WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST THE
    COMPANY FOR ITS DECISION REGARDING THE FINAL DISPOSITION OR PLACEMENT OF THE
    CROSSENROLLED ORGANIZATION. &ldquo;Upline&rdquo; shall mean the organization
    of Independent Brand Ambassadors enrolled and placed above any Independent
    Brand Ambassador.
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Targeting Other Direct Sellers</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1. INSPYRE does not condone Brand Ambassadors specifically or consciously
    targeting the sales force of another direct sales company to sell INSPYRE
    products or to become IBAs for INSPYRE, nor does INSPYRE condone Brand
    Ambassador solicitation or enticement of members of the sales force of
    another direct sales company to violate the terms of their contract with
    such other company. Should Brand Ambassador engage in such activity, they
    bear the risk of being sued by the other direct sales company. If any
    lawsuit, arbitration or mediation is brought against a Brand Ambassador
    alleging that he or she engaged in an inappropriate recruiting activity of
    its sales force or customers, INSPYRE will not pay any of the Brand
    Ambassador's defense costs or legal fees, nor will INSPYRE indemnify the
    Brand Ambassador for any judgment, award, or settlement
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Errors and Questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  If a Brand Ambassador has questions about or believes any errors have been
  made regarding commissions, bonuses, Downline Activity Reports, or charges,
  the Ambassador must notify the INSPYRE Brand Ambassador Support Department at
  support@inspyreww.com, in writing, within 5 &ndash; 7 days of the date of the
  purported error or incident in question. INSPYRE will not be responsible for
  any errors, omissions or problems not reported to the Company within 7 days.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sales Aids and Optional </strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1.1. Brand Ambassadors are not required to purchase or carry sales aids.
    Brand Ambassadors who do so must make his or her own decision regarding
    these matters. Absolutely no use of the InspYre name may be used on
    marketing materials, including any social media such as Facebook or
    Instagram. To ensure that Brand Ambassadors are not encumbered with Company
    Sales Aids, such Sales Aids may be returned to InspYre upon the Brand
    Ambassador&rsquo;s cancellation pursuant to the terms of Section
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Governmental Approval or Endorsement </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Neither federal nor state regulatory agencies or officials approve or endorse
  any direct selling or network marketing companies or programs. Therefore,
  Brand Ambassadors shall not represent or imply that INSPYRE or its
  Compensation Plan have been "approved," "endorsed" or otherwise sanctioned by
  any government agency.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Manipulating Applications or Enrollments</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1.1. Brand Ambassadors must not manipulate enrollments of new Brand
    Ambassadors or customer orders.
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Income Taxes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Each Brand Ambassador is responsible for paying local, state, and federal
  taxes on any income generated as an Independent Brand Ambassador.
  Unfortunately, we cannot provide you with any personal tax advice. Please
  consult your own tax accountant, tax attorney, or other tax professional. If a
  Brand Ambassador&rsquo;s INSPYRE business is tax exempt, the Federal tax
  identification number must be provided to INSPYRE Every year, INSPYRE will
  provide an SARS Form 1099 MISC (Non-employee Compensation) earnings statement
  to each U.S. resident who: (1) Had earnings of over $600 in the previous
  calendar year; or (2) Made purchases during the previous calendar year in
  excess of $5,000.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Independent Contractor Status </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Brand Ambassadors are independent contractors. The agreement between INSPYRE
  and its Brand Ambassadors does not create an employer/employee relationship,
  agency, partnership, or joint venture between the Company and the Brand
  Ambassador. Brand Ambassadors shall not be treated as an employee for his or
  her services or for Federal or State tax purposes. All Brand Ambassadors are
  responsible for paying local, state, and federal taxes due from all
  compensation earned as a Brand Ambassador of the Company. The Brand Ambassador
  has no authority (expressed or implied), to bind the Company to any
  obligation. Each Brand Ambassador shall establish his or her own goals, hours,
  and methods of sale, so long as he or she complies with the terms of the Brand
  Ambassador Agreement, these Policies and Procedures, and applicable laws.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Insurance</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  You may wish to arrange insurance coverage for your business. Your homeowner's
  insurance policy does not cover business-related injuries, or the theft of or
  damage to inventory or business equipment. Contact your insurance agent to
  make certain that your business property is protected. This can often be
  accomplished with a simple "Business Pursuit" endorsement attached to your
  present home owner's policy.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>International Marketing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Brand Ambassadors are authorized to sell INSPYRE products, and enroll
  Customers or Brand Ambassadors only in the countries in which INSPYRE is
  authorized to conduct business, as announced in official Company literature.
  INSPYRE products or sales aids may not be shipped into or sold in any foreign
  country. Brand Ambassadors may sell, give, transfer, or distribute INSPYRE
  products or sales aids only in their home country. In addition, no Brand
  Ambassador may, in any unauthorized country: (a) conduct sales, enrollment or
  training meetings; (b) enroll or attempt to enroll potential Customers
  or&nbsp; Brand Ambassadors; or (c) conduct any other activity for the purpose
  of selling INSPYRE products, establishing a marketing organization, or
  promoting the INSPYRE opportunity. The violation of this policy will result in
  the immediate termination of the Brand Ambassador Agreement, and may also
  result in criminal prosecution by U.S and international authorities.&nbsp;
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Excess Inventory and Bonus Buying</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Brand Ambassadors must never purchase more products than they can reasonably
  use or sell to retail customers in a month, and must not influence or attempt
  to influence any other Brand Ambassador to buy more products than they can
  reasonably use or sell to retail customers in a month. In addition, bonus
  buying is strictly prohibited. Bonus buying includes any mechanism or artifice
  to qualify for rank advancement, incentives, prizes, commissions or bonuses
  that is not driven by bona fide product or service purchases by end-user
  consumers. Bonus buying includes, but is not limited to, purchasing products
  through a straw man or other artifice.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Adherence to Laws, Regulations and the Agreement </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Brand Ambassadors must comply with all federal, state, and local laws,
  regulations, ordinances, codes, and the terms of the Agreement in the conduct
  of their businesses. Many cities and counties have laws regulating certain
  home-based businesses. In most cases these ordinances are not applicable to
  Brand Ambassadors because of the nature of their business. However, Brand
  Ambassadors must obey those laws that do apply to them. If a city or county
  official tells a Brand Ambassador that an ordinance applies to him or her, the
  Brand Ambassador shall be polite and cooperative, and immediately send a copy
  of the ordinance to the Compliance Department of INSPYRE In addition, Brand
  Ambassadors must not recommend, encourage or teach other Brand Ambassadors to
  violate federal, state, or local laws, regulations, ordinances, codes, or the
  terms of the Agreement in the operation of their INSPYRE business.&nbsp;
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>One INSPYRE Business Per Brand Ambassador</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
  A Brand Ambassador may operate or have an ownership interest, legal or
  equitable, as a sole proprietorship, partner, shareholder, trustee, or
  beneficiary, in only one INSPYRE business. No individual may have, operate or
  receive compensation from more than one INSPYRE business. The Individual
  ownership of an INSPYRE Brand Ambassador position must match the credit card
  on file,&nbsp; shipping address, and payment/commission information. If we
  discover that a Brand Ambassador is monetizing multiple positions in multiple
  organizations, we view this as 100% unethical. Additionally, we reserve the
  right to suspend commissions, remove back-office access, move duplicate
  positions back to their original placement, or terminate the Brand
  Ambassador's account.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Roll-up of Organization</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1. When a vacancy occurs in a Marketing Organization due to the termination
    of an INSPYRE business, each Brand Ambassador in the first level immediately
    below the terminated Brand Ambassador on the date of the termination will be
    moved to the first level ("front line") of the terminated Brand Ambassador's
    enroller. For example, if A sponsors B, and B sponsors Cl, C2, and C3, if B
    terminates her business, Cl, C2, and C3 will "roll-up" to A and become part
    of A's first level. Please note: 1. If the purged brand ambassador has only
    one leg, and it is the leg they are on, the brand ambassador is removed and
    the IBA/customer directly below them moves up 1 spot. 2. If the IBA has more
    than one leg or the only leg of the IBA is the opposite leg that they are
    on, the brand ambassador position remains as a placeholder until they meet
    the conditions above and can be removed.
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sale, Transfer or Assignment of INSPYRE Business</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1. Although an INSPYRE business is a privately owned, independently operated
    business, the sale, transfer, or assignment of an INSPYRE business, and the
    sale, transfer or assignment of an interest in a Business Entity that owns
    or operates an INSPYRE Ambassador business, is subject to certain
    limitations. If an Ambassador wishes to sell his or her INSPYRE business, or
    interest in a Business Entity that owns or operates an INSPYRE business, the
    following criteria must be met:
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.1. The selling Ambassador must offer INSPYRE the right of first
        refusal to purchase the business on the same terms as agreed upon with a
        third-party buyer. INSPYRE shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of
        receipt of the written offer from the seller to exercise its right of
        first refusal.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.2. The buyer or transferee must become a qualified Brand Ambassador.
        If the buyer is an active INSPYRE Brand Ambassador, he or she must first
        terminate his or her INSPYRE business and however the six (6) calendar
        month waiting period may be waived before acquiring any interest in the
        new INSPYRE business;
      </li>
      <li>
        1.3. Before the sale, transfer or assignment can be finalized and
        approved by INSPYRE, any debt obligations the selling party has with
        INSPYRE must be satisfied.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.4. The selling party must be in good standing and not in violation of
        any of the terms of the Agreement in order to be eligible to sell,
        transfer or assign an INSPYRE Brand Ambassador business.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.5. Prior to selling a Business Entity interest, the selling party must
        notify INSPYRE&rsquo;s Compliance Department in writing and advise of
        his or her intent to sell INSPYRE&rsquo;s business or Business Entity
        interest. The selling party must also receive written approval from the
        Compliance Department before proceeding with the sale.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.6. Required Documentation &ndash; There are instances where transfer
        of ownership of an account will be permitted with appropriate documents
        filled out. All Brand Ambassadors that are approved for this transfer of
        ownership will be required to fill out the &lsquo;Transfer of Ownership
        Form&rsquo;.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Separation of an INSPYRE Business</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1. INSPYRE Brand Ambassadors sometimes operate their INSPYRE businesses as
    husband-wife partnerships, regular partnerships, limited liability
    companies, corporations, trusts, or other Business Entities. At such time as
    a marriage may end in divorce or a corporation, limited liability company,
    partnership, trust or other Business Entity may dissolve, arrangements must
    be made to assure that any separation or division of the business is
    accomplished so as not to adversely affect the interests and income of other
    businesses up or down the line of sponsorship. During the divorce or entity
    dissolution process, the parties must adopt one of the following methods of
    operation:
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.1. One of the parties may, with the consent of the other(s), operate
        the INSPYRE business pursuant to an assignment in writing whereby the
        relinquishing spouse, shareholders, partners or trustees authorize
        INSPYRE to deal directly and solely with the other spouse or
        non-relinquishing shareholder, member, partner, or trustee.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.2. The parties may continue to operate the INSPYRE business jointly on
        a "business-as-usual" basis, whereupon all compensation paid by INSPYRE
        will be paid according to the status quo as it existed prior to the
        divorce filing or dissolution proceedings. This is the default procedure
        if the parties do not agree on the format set forth above.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    2. Under no circumstances will the downline organization of divorcing
    spouses or a dissolving business entity be divided. Similarly, under no
    circumstances will INSPYRE split commission and bonus checks between
    divorcing spouses or members of dissolving entities. INSPYRE will recognize
    only one downline organization and will issue only one commission check per
    INSPYRE business per commission cycle. Commission checks shall always be
    issued to the same individual or entity.
  </li>
  <li>
    3. If a former spouse has completely relinquished all rights in the original
    INSPYRE business pursuant to a divorce, he or she is thereafter free to
    enroll under any sponsor of his or her choosing without waiting six calendar
    months. In the case of business entity dissolutions, the former partner,
    shareholder, member, or other entity Brand Ambassador who retains no
    interest in the business must wait six calendar months from the date of the
    final dissolution before re-enrolling as a Brand Ambassador. In either case,
    the former spouse or business brand ambassador shall have no rights to any
    IBA in their former organization or to any former Customer. They must
    develop the new business in the same manner as would any other new IBA.
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Organizational Structure &amp; Sponsoring</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1. When sponsoring a new Brand Ambassador through the online enrollment
    process, the sponsor may assist the new applicant in filling out the
    enrollment materials. However, the applicant must personally review and
    agree to the online application and agreement, INSPYRE's Policies and
    Procedures, and the INSPYRE Compensation Plan. The sponsor may not fill out
    the online Brand Ambassador Application and Agreement on behalf of the
    applicant and agree to these materials on behalf of the applicant.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1.1. </strong><strong>Succession</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1.1.1. Upon the death or incapacitation of a Brand Ambassador, his
            or her business may be passed to his or her heirs. Appropriate legal
            documentation must be submitted to the Company to ensure the
            transfer is proper. Accordingly, a Brand Ambassador should consult
            an attorney to assist him or her in the preparation of a will or
            other testamentary instrument. Whenever an INSPYRE business is
            transferred by a will or other testamentary process, the beneficiary
            acquires the right to collect all bonuses and commissions of the
            deceased Brand Ambassador's marketing organization provided the
            following qualifications are met. The successor(s) must:
            <ul>
              <li>1.1.1.1. Execute a Brand Ambassador Agreement;</li>
              <li>
                1.1.1.2. Comply with terms and provisions of the Agreement;
              </li>

                Ambassador's status;
              </li>
              <li>
                1.1.1.4. The devisee must provide INSPYRE with an "address of
                record" to which all bonus and commission checks will be sent;
              </li>
              <li>
                1.1.1.5. If the business is bequeathed to joint devisees, they
                must form a business entity and acquire a Federal Taxpayer
                Identification Number. INSPYRE will issue all bonus and
                commission checks and one 1099 to the business entity.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            1.2. Transfer Upon Death of a Brand Ambassador
            <ul>
              <li>
                1.2.1. To effect a testamentary transfer of an INSPYRE business,
                the executor of the estate must provide the following to
                INSPYRE: (1) an original death certificate; (2) certified
                letters testamentary or a letter of administration appointing an
                executor; and (3) written instructions from the authorized
                executor to INSPYRE specifying to whom the business and income
                should be transferred.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            1.3. Transfer Upon Incapacitation of a Brand Ambassador
            <ul>
              <li>
                1.3.1. To effectuate a transfer of an INSPYRE business because
                of incapacity, the successor must provide the following to
                INSPYRE: (1) a notarized copy of an appointment as trustee; (2)
                a notarized copy of the trust document or other documentation
                establishing the trustee's right to administer the INSPYRE
                business; and (3) a completed Brand Ambassador Agreement
                executed by the trustee.
              </li>
            </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Telemarketing Techniques</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1. The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission
    each have laws that restrict telemarketing practices. Both federal agencies
    (as well as a number of states) have "do not call" regulations as part of
    their telemarketing laws. Although INSPYRE does not consider Brand
    Ambassadors to be "telemarketers" in the traditional sense of the word,
    these government regulations broadly define the term "telemarketer" and
    "telemarketing" so that your inadvertent action of calling someone whose
    telephone number is listed on the federal "do not call" registry could cause
    you to violate the law. Moreover, these regulations must not be taken
    lightly, as they carry significant penalties. Therefore, Brand Ambassadors
    must not engage in telemarketing in the operation of their INSPYRE
    businesses. The term "telemarketing" means the placing of one or more
    telephone calls to an individual or entity to induce the purchase of an
    INSPYRE product or service or to recruit them for the INSPYRE opportunity.
    "Cold calls" made to prospective customers or Brand Ambassadors that promote
    either INSPYRE's products or the INSPYRE opportunity constitute
    telemarketing and are prohibited. However, a telephone call(s) placed to a
    prospective customer or Brand Ambassador (a "prospect") is permissible under
    the following situations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.1. If the Brand Ambassador has an established business relationship
        with the prospect. An "established business relationship" is a
        relationship between a Brand Ambassador and a prospect based on the
        prospect's purchase, rental, or lease of goods or services from the
        Brand Ambassador, or a financial transaction between the prospect and
        the Brand Ambassador, within the eighteen (18) months immediately
        preceding the date of a telephone call to induce the prospect's purchase
        of a product or service.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.2. The prospect's personal inquiry or application regarding a product
        or service offered by the Brand Ambassador, within the three (3) months
        immediately preceding the date of such a call.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.3. If the Brand Ambassador receives written and signed permission from
        the prospect authorizing the Brand Ambassador to call. The authorization
        must specify the telephone number(s) which the Brand Ambassador is
        authorized to call.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.4. You may call family members, personal friends, and acquaintances.
        An "acquaintance" is someone with whom you have at least a recent
        first-hand relationship within the preceding three months. Bear in mind,
        however, that if you engage in "card collecting" with everyone you meet
        and subsequently calling them, the FTC may consider this a form of
        telemarketing that is not subject to this exemption. Thus, if you engage
        in calling "acquaintances," you must make such calls on an occasional
        basis only and not make this a routine practice.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.5. Brand Ambassadors shall not use automatic telephone dialing systems
        or software relative to the operation of their INSPYRE businesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.6. Brand Ambassadors shall not place or initiate any outbound
        telephone call to any person that delivers any pre-recorded message (a
        "robocall") regarding or relating to the INSPYRE products or
        opportunity.

<ul>
  <li>
    1. INSPYRE makes online back offices available to its Brand Ambassadors.
    Back offices provide Brand Ambassadors access to confidential and
    proprietary information that may be used solely and exclusively to promote
    the development of a Brand Ambassador's INSPYRE business and to increase
    sales of INSPYRE products. However, access to a back-office is a privilege
    and not a right. INSPYRE reserves the right to deny Brand Ambassadors access
    to the back office at its sole discretion.
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Unauthorized Communication</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1. In the excitement and enthusiasm of working his or her INSPYRE business,
    a Brand Ambassador may attempt to contact the Company's vendors, suppliers,
    or advisors with questions or ideas. Any such communication without the
    Company's prior written consent is strictly prohibited. Vendors, suppliers,
    and advisors are often not set up to handle a large volume of contacts.
    Equally important, we must respect their rights to privacy. Questions
    regarding any of these Entities may be directed to Field Support.
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Stacking</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1. &ldquo;Stacking&rdquo; is strictly prohibited. The term
    &ldquo;stacking&rdquo; includes: (a) violating the
    one&ndash;business&ndash;per&ndash;household rule and/or (b) enrolling
    fictitious individuals or entities into the INSPYRE Compensation Plan, in an
    attempt to manipulate the Compensation Plan.

</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Enrolling</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    1. All active Brand Ambassadors in good standing have the right to enroll
    others into INSPYRE. Each prospective Brand Ambassador has the ultimate
    right to choose his or her own enroller. If two Brand Ambassadors claim to
    be the enroller of the same new Brand Ambassador, the Company shall regard
    the first application received by the Company as controlling.
